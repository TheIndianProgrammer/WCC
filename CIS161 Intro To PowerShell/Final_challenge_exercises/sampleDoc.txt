Possible starting places for your text analysis include an author's life, politics, the social
 context of the work, philosophical musings, how and why the work evokes a particular 
feeling in you, cultural relevance, or the components of the text such as the significance 
of setting, narrative voice, imagery, or symbolism. Or, perhaps you will read a critical 
approach to the text and use it as a springboard for your own ideas (the library 
database Contemporary Literary Criticism Select is often a nice starting place). Or, you 
may wish to explore the relationship between various elements of the text (How does 
setting influence character?). Or, perhaps you would like to build on an idea touched on 
in class discussion. As we move on into the later weeks of the course, you may even wish 
to direct your questions toward identifying patterns between texts, and asking what the 
significance of these patterns might be.
